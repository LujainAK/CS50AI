# Crossword - CS50AI Constraints Satisfaction Problem & Backtracking Project
The project is part of the [CS50AI](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home) online course by Harvard University. This project aims to build an AI to solve the Crossword game using the Constraint Satisfaction Problem and Backtracking Algorithms. Also, the AC3 algorithm was used to check the arc consistency.

All the background and specification details are on the exercise's page [HERE](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/3/crossword/). 

## Demo
A YouTube video to show the functionality demonstration of the project: [Click Here](https://youtu.be/OZoFSIDbzNg).

## Installation
Download the files `generate.py`, and `crossword.py`, as well as the directories `data` and `assets`. Make sure they are all in the same directory named `crossword`.

## Credits
The functions `enforce_node_consistency`, `revise`, `ac3`, `assignment_complete`, `consistent`, `order_domain_values`, `selected_unassigned_variable`, and `backtrack` in `generate.py` were implemented by Lujain Alkhelb. Everything else was implemented by the CS50AI course staff.
