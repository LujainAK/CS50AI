# TicTacToe - CS50AI Minimax Algorithm Project
The project is part of the [CS50AI](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home) online course by Harvard University. This project aims to make an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using the Minimax algorithm.

All the background and specification details are on the exercise's page [HERE](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/tictactoe/). 

## Demo
A YouTube video to show the functionality demonstration of the project: [Click Here](https://youtu.be/UyF5G5YQVhc).

## Installation
1. Download the files `runner.py`, and `tictactoe.py`, as well as the requirements file `requirements.txt`. Make sure they are all in the same directory named `tictactoe`.
2. Install the package `pygame` by getting inside the `tictactoe` directory and run
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Credits
The functions `player`, `actions`, `result`, `winner`, `terminal`, `utility`, `minimax`, and `minimaxHelp` were implemented by Lujain Alkhelb. Everything else was implemented by the CS50AI course staff.
