# Knights - CS50AI Inference Rules Project
The project is part of the [CS50AI](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home) online course by Harvard University. This project aims to make an AI that solves the Knights or Knaves puzzle using Inference Rules. The code includes 4 puzzles ordered based on the difficulty level.

All the background and specification details are on the exercise's page [HERE](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/knights/).
