# Heredity - CS50AI Probability Distribution Project
The project is part of the [CS50AI](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home) online course by Harvard University. Given a database about family members and their [GJB2 genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1285178/) which is the hearing impairment version of GJB2, the AI will infer the probability distribution for each personâ€™s genes in the database, as well as the probability distribution for whether any person will exhibit the trait.

All the background and specification details are on the exercise's page [HERE](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/2/heredity/). 

## Demo
A YouTube video to show the functionality demonstration of the project: [Click Here](https://youtu.be/8V28KaygHbo).

## Installation
Download the file `heredity.py`, and the directory of the databases `data` which contains the databases `family0.csv`, `family1.csv`, and `family2.csv`. Make sure the `heredity.py` file and the `data` directory are in the same directory named `heredity`.

## Credits
The functions `mutation`, `joint_probability`, `update`, and `normalize` were implemented by Lujain Alkhelb. Everything else was implemented by the CS50AI course staff.
