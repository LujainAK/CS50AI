# CS50AI
Hi there! My name is [Lujain Alkhelb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lujainalkhelb/), and this is all the projects I have worked on for the [CS50AI](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home) online course from Harvard University. It covers various topics in Artificial Intelligence, such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, and more.
