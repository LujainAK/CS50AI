# Degrees - CS50AI Breadth-First Search Project
The project is part of the [CS50AI](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home) online course by Harvard University. This project aims to find the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them using Breadth-First Search algorithm and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/)'s database.

All the background and specification details are on the exercise's page [HERE](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/degrees/). 

## Demo

## Installation
Download the files `degrees.py`, and `util.py`, as well as the directory of the databases `large` or/and `small` if you would like. Make sure they are all in the same directory named `degrees`.

## Credits
The `shortest_path` function was implemented by Lujain Alkhelb. Everything else was implemented by the CS50AI course staff.
